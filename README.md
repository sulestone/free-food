Free Food App

Welcome to the Free Food App! We help businesses and customers connect with each other through free food events held by local businesses. Finding an event is easy. Just check the map to see all the local businesses that are hosting free food events near you.

General Assembly Atlanta WDI Project 3 Team members: Britney Dossett, Sule Stone and Cynthia Hanna

For our project 3, we used the following technologies:

1. Express 
2. Node 
3. MongoDB/Mongoose 
4. Passport 
5. Google Maps API 
6. Bootstrap 
7. Heroku 
8. Bower 
9. npm
We envisioned this app to be a platform to allow businesses to promote their free food events, and an easy way for customers to find events near them. To accomplish this, we built a Food Model and a User Model. Because of time constraints, the User Model currently encapsulates both types of users: business and individual. Eventually, these will be separated. We also would like to allow individuals to rate the food.

We had a few hurdles to overcome. We did have database problems to work out, getting the google map API to render event markers and Bootstrap styling headaches.
